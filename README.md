I discovered my passion for coding in high school, beginning with Java and Python. Over the past few years, I've expanded into building full-stack web applications and exploring machine learning projects. I've created projects like SummarizeMe, a Chrome extension that summarizes web content which reached over 500 user! and LungAI, an AI-driven web app that predicts lung cancer from CT scans. Recently, I've been diving into C# to broaden my development skills.
